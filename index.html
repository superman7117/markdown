### (feat. Just-in Timber-lake)

Hey girl I got somethin' real important to give you

So just sit down and listen

Girl you know we've been together such a long long time (such a long time)

And now I'm ready to lay it on the line

(Wooow) You know it's Christmas and my heart is open wide

Gonna give you something so you know what's on my mind

A gift real special, so take off the top

Take a look inside --

## it's my dick in a box

Not gonna get you a diamond ring

That sort of gift don't mean anything

Not gonna get you a fancy car

Girl ya gotta know you're my shining star

Not gonna get you a house in the hills

A girl like you needs somethin' real

Wanna get you somethin' from the heart

Somethin' special girl
>It's my **div in a box, **

>my **div in a box** babe

>It's my **div in a box**,

>my **div in a box** #  girl


>See I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs givin' (yeah)

>And I got just the one, somethin' to show ya that you are second to none

To all the fellas out there with ladies to impress

It's easy to do just follow these steps
- 1: Cut a hole in a box
- 2: Put your junk in that box
- 3: Make her open the box

>And that's the way you do it

>It's my **div in a box...**

>my **div in a box** babe

>It's my **div in a box,**

>my **div in a box** girl
- Christmas; **div in a box**
- Hanukkah; **div in a box**
- Kwanzaa; **a div in a box**

Every single holiday a **div in a box**

Over at your parent's house a **div in a box**

Mid day at the grocery store a **div in a box**

Backstage at the CMA's
